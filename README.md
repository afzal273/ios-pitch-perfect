# Pitch Perfect iOS

This is an iOS app that records sound and plays back with effects (slow, fast, chipmunk and Darth Vader).

This app was made during Udacity's [Intro to IOS course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud585) that I took recently. This is a great class and I learnt a lot of iOS concepts. Big thanks to Kunal who is an awesome instructor!
